# Meal-Helper
I made meal helper after being annoyed at having to manually look-up recipes and make shopping lists. 

Meal Helper allows you to create and store as many meals as you'd like and for each meal, add ingredients of 
various types and quantites and add a list of ordered instructions.

After meals are entered, you can use meal helper to generate a random or custom 1 or 2 week meal plan. 
After generation, Meal Helper adds your meals to the calendar of your choice and the combines the listed
ingredients from each meal-plan meal into a shopping list.

Additionally, Meal Helper allows you to export and import meals, allowing you to share meals with included ingredients and instructions.

Note: -This is a proof of concept and not intended as a release version.
      -This version currently only supports macOS
